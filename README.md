# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

## Introduction
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This project uses a dataset of Titanic passengers to predict survival outcomes.


## Model
The model used for predicting Titanic survival is a Logistic Regression model. The data preprocessing includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features. The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
The model achieved the following performance metrics:
- Accuracy:0.8100558659217877
- Precision: 0.83
- Recall: 0.86
- F1 Score: 0.84
